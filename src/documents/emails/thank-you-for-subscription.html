Thank you for interesting in SolidBuild!
</div>
<br/>
We are currently in closed beta so let us tell you why we donâ€™t send invites immediately.
<br/>
<br/>
<b style="color: #000;">You invite will be dispatched from couple of days to couple of weeks.</b>
<br/>
For making our product better we need to hear a feedback from people with fresh eye. Once a 2-3 weeks when we ready with new update we send a dozen of invites and several days after we are asking an opinion about new features, improvements and wishes.
<br/>
<br/>
<b style="color: #000;">Follow us on twitter to be informed about SolidBuild news and updates.</b>
