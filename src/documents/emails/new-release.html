Hi, %recipient.first-name%!
</div>
<br/>
We deployed a new version of SolidBuild. In this version we added ability to specify PowerShell commands on the script edit page.
Check this out in your account.
<br/>
Also we fixed a bug which prevented creation of scripts.
Existing scripts worked as expected and weren't affected by this bug.
<br/>

I'm really happy that you started using our service. Feel free to email me if you have a question or want to share your feedback.

Cheers,
<br/>
Sergey, founder
