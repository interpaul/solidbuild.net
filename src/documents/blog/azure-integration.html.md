Today we officially announce Azure integration. It means that now you can create build agents in Azure inside SolidBuild web app.

In order to create build agent in Azure you should click "Create new agent in Azure" link on Agents page.

Also we added functionality for stopping your Azure machine after one hour of inactivity, so you don't have to pay for time when your agent has nothing to build.

Now we one step closer to our goal - completely automation of development process.
