#### Performance improvements
In this release the performance was dramatically improved. Instead of talking too much about it you can log in and check this out yourself.

#### Changes on Scripts page
We united Scripts and Overview pages in one SPA.

#### Environments page
We added a new page - Environments. The idea of this page is to have one place where you can see the status of your agents and currently executing scripts.

Cheers
