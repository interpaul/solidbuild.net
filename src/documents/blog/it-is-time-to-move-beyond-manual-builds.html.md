Continuous integration is well-known practice in software development world. In [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) you can find theory about continuous integration process, but here I'd like to tell you about benefits.

####What are benefits of continuous integration(CI)?
It's hard to imagine how developers worked without CI in the past. Nowadays it's one of the most important tools for developers. Below is a list of benefits for the majority of projects.

#####CI shows the pulse of your project
CI server allows you to know the status of your project in any given point in time. It aggregates statistics for all failed and passed tests. CI server builds your project and stores all warnings and errors. Having all this information in one place you can make decision about the current status of the project.

#####Painless integration
Imagine a team of very good developers. They know a lot of patterns and can write clean code in several languages. And even this team can have problems with integration. When someone checks in code she should be sure that everything is fine. CI server provides functionality for building project and running tests after each change. In case of any errors the server can notify developers. As a result you have less bugs in your project.

#####Always stable code base
If you know that the code which you checked in a seconds ago passed all tests you can be sure in your code. In conjunction with a high level of coverage you can be sure in the project. If you are sure in your code, then you can deploy your project without a fear of introducing new errors.
